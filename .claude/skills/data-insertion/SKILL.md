# CSV Data Insertion

Create, modify, or troubleshoot CSV seed data files for Deepsel CMS backend apps.

## Arguments

- `$0` — App name (e.g., `cms`, `core`, `locales`)
- `$1` — (optional) `data` for regular seed data, `demo_data` for demo data. Defaults to `data`.

If arguments are missing, ask the user which app and data type they need.

## When to Use

- User asks to add seed/initial data for a model
- User wants to create demo data for an app
- User needs to fix or extend existing CSV import files
- User asks about CSV import format or special column syntax

## Reference

Read `backend/docs/DataInsertion.md` for the full specification. The key details are summarized below.

## File Structure

```
apps/{app_name}/{data|demo_data}/
├── __init__.py          # Contains import_order list
├── model1.csv           # CSV files (filename = model's __tablename__)
├── model2.csv
└── attachments/         # Optional: binary files referenced by CSV
```

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Target Model

1. Read the model file in `apps/{app_name}/models/` to understand:
   - `__tablename__` (this becomes the CSV filename)
   - Column names, types, and constraints
   - Foreign key relationships
   - Whether the model uses `OrganizationMetaDataMixin` or `BaseModel`
2. Check existing data files in `apps/{app_name}/{data|demo_data}/` for patterns

### Step 2: Create or Update `__init__.py`

The `__init__.py` must contain an `import_order` list. Order matters — parent tables before child tables:

```python
import_order = [
    "parent_model.csv",    # No dependencies
    "child_model.csv",     # Depends on parent_model
]
```

If the file already exists, append new CSVs in the correct dependency order.

### Step 3: Write the CSV File

**Filename**: Must match the model's `__tablename__` (e.g., model with `__tablename__ = "blog_post"` → `blog_post.csv`).

**Required columns**:
- `string_id` — unique identifier (required for regular data, optional for demo data)

**All values must be quoted** except booleans (`true`/`false`).

### Step 4: Handle Special Columns

#### Foreign Key References: `<table>/<field>`
Reference related records by their `string_id`:
```csv
"title","locale/locale_id","page/page_id"
"Home Page","en_US","demo_home_page"
```
Resolves `locale/locale_id` → finds locale with `string_id="en_US"`, uses its `id`.

#### File Content: `file:<field_name>`
Reads file content into a field:
```csv
"string_id","file:translations"
"header","apps/cms/data/header.json"
```

#### File Attachments: `attachment:<field_name>`
Creates an attachment record and stores its ID:
```csv
"string_id","attachment:featured_image_id"
"blog_post_1","apps/cms/demo_data/images/featured.jpg"
```

#### Standalone Attachments
Create `attachments.csv` with `file_path` column:
```csv
"string_id","file_path","alt_text","system"
"hero_banner","apps/cms/data/attachments/hero.jpg","Hero banner",true
```

#### JSON Content: `json:<field_name>`
Parses JSON string into a JSON object. Supports recursive foreign key resolution inside the JSON:
```csv
"string_id","json:translations"
"main_menu","{\"en\": {\"title\": \"Home\", \"page_content/page_content_id\": \"HomePage_en\"}}"
```
The `page_content/page_content_id` key inside the JSON will be resolved to the actual ID.

### Step 5: Verify

1. Check that all referenced `string_id` values exist in their respective CSVs (or will be created by earlier CSVs in the import order)
2. Check that all referenced files exist (for `file:` and `attachment:` columns)
3. Check that JSON strings are valid (for `json:` columns)
4. Verify import order respects foreign key dependencies

## Import Behavior

### Regular Data (`data/`)
- Loaded automatically at startup for all installed apps via `install_seed_data()` from `deepsel`
- Checks for existing records by `string_id`
- Updates only if record has `system=True`
- Skips if record has `system=False` (preserves user changes)
- Creates new if record doesn't exist

### Demo Data (`demo_data/`)

Demo data can be loaded in two ways:

1. **At startup (once)** — `install_seed_data()` (from `deepsel.utils.install_apps`) loads `demo_data/` folders alongside `data/` for all installed apps. It uses a `_demo_data_installed` tracking table in the database to ensure each app's demo data is only imported once. On subsequent restarts the import is skipped.
2. **On demand** — `POST /load_demo_data/{app_name}` (admin UI: Organization → Settings → General → Installed Business Apps → select app → Load demo data). Requires admin privileges. This does **not** check the tracking table, so it can re-insert data.

**Behavior**:
- Always creates new records (no existence check by `string_id`)
- `string_id` is optional
- On-demand loading can cause duplicates if run multiple times (startup loading is protected by the tracking table)

## Default Value Handling

- `organization_id` — auto-assigned to default organization if not specified
- `owner_id` — auto-assigned to default system user if not specified
- Booleans — `"true"`/`"True"`/`"1"` → `True`; `"false"`/`"False"`/`"0"` → `False`

## Common Patterns

### Multilingual content
```csv
"title","slug","locale/locale_id","page/page_id"
"Home Page","home-page","en_US","home"
"Startseite","startseite","de_DE","home"
```

### Blog with featured images
```csv
"string_id","published","attachment:featured_image_id"
"tech_post_1",true,"demo_data/images/tech-featured.jpg"
```

### Menu with nested JSON translations
```csv
"string_id","json:translations"
"main_menu","{\"en\": {\"title\": \"Home\", \"page_content/page_content_id\": \"HomePage_en\", \"use_page_title\": true}, \"de\": {\"title\": \"Startseite\", \"page_content/page_content_id\": \"HomePage_de\", \"use_page_title\": true}}"
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Integrity error on import** — duplicate `string_id` or unique constraint violation. Check for duplicates across CSVs.
- **Missing reference** — the referenced `string_id` doesn't exist. Check import order and that the parent CSV is listed first.
- **File not found** — file path in `file:` or `attachment:` column doesn't exist. Paths are relative to `backend/` root.
- **Invalid JSON** — malformed JSON in `json:` column. Validate the JSON string (watch for escaping: `\"` inside CSV).

## Theme Seed Data

Themes can include seed data in `themes/{theme_name}/data/` using the same CSV format as app data.

### Structure

```
themes/{theme_name}/data/
├── __init__.py      # import_order + optional post_install(db)
└── menu.csv
```

### `post_install(db)` Hook

`__init__.py` can define a `post_install(db)` function for non-CSV operations (e.g., configuring site language defaults, updating CMS settings). It receives a SQLAlchemy session and runs after all CSVs are imported.

```python
import_order = ["menu.csv"]

def post_install(db):
    """Custom setup logic after CSV import."""
    # e.g., set default language, configure available languages
    pass
```

### Loading

Theme seed data is loaded by `load_seed_data_for_theme()` in `backend/apps/cms/utils/setup_themes.py` when a theme is selected — either via the `/theme/select` API or when the default theme is set on a fresh DB. It does **not** run on every server restart.
