"""
Email Rate Limiting (Dosing) System

This module provides functionality to control email sending rates to prevent abuse
and comply with email provider limits.

Features:
- Global rate limiting for system-wide email sending
- Support for future user/campaign/scope-based limits
- Automatic cleanup of expired timestamps
- Thread-safe operations
